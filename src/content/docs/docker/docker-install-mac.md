Installing Docker on a Mac is very easy because Docker provides a nice app called **Docker Desktop**. 🍎

### Step 1: Download Docker Desktop

1. Go to the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Click the download button for Mac. 
   - **Note**: Choose the correct version for your Mac (Intel chip or Apple Silicon/M1/M2/M3).

### Step 2: Install the App

1. Once the download is finished, double-click the `.dmg` file.
2. Drag the Docker icon into your **Applications** folder.

### Step 3: Start Docker

1. Open your **Applications** folder and double-click **Docker**.
2. You might see a little whale icon in your top menu bar. Wait for it to stop moving—this means Docker is ready!

### Step 4: Verify the installation

Open your terminal and type:

```bash
docker --version
```

If you see a version number, congratulations! You have successfully installed Docker on your Mac. 🚀
