**SQL**, short for **Structured Query Language**, is a standard language used to work with **relational databases**. It’s how we communicate with a database — asking it questions, giving it instructions, and defining how data is stored.

Think of SQL as the language you use to:

* Describe what kind of data you want to store (like names, dates, or numbers).
* Define how different pieces of data relate to each other.
* Ask questions like “What are all the users who signed up last week?”
* Make changes to how the database is structured.

SQL has been around since the 1970s and remains the most widely used language for relational database systems. It’s supported by popular databases like:

* **MySQL**
* **PostgreSQL**
* **SQLite**
* **SQL Server**
* **Oracle Database**

### 🧠 Why SQL matters

Even if you're not a full-time backend developer or data analyst, knowing SQL gives you the power to:

* Understand how data is organized
* Access and explore datasets
* Work with APIs or apps that rely on databases
* Make better data-driven decisions

SQL is readable and closer to English than most programming languages, which makes it easier to learn and pick up quickly — even for beginners.
