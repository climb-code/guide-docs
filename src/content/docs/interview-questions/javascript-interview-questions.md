### 1. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is synchronous single-threaded  high-level, dynamic, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on websites but is also widely used in server-side development with platforms like Node.js.

#### Key Characteristics

* **Single-threaded**:
  JavaScript operates in a single-threaded environment, meaning it executes one command at a time in a single sequence. This is managed by the **JavaScript event loop**, which allows it to handle tasks like UI rendering and event handling without blocking the main thread.

* **Synchronous and Asynchronous Execution**:
  By default, JavaScript executes code synchronouslyâ€”one line at a time, in order. However, it supports **asynchronous programming** using **callbacks**, **Promises**, and `async/await`, which allows it to perform non-blocking operations like fetching data from an API or reading files in the background.

* **Interpreted Language**:
  JavaScript code is executed line-by-line by the JavaScript engine (such as V8 in Chrome) without the need for a separate compilation step.

* **Dynamically Typed**:
  Variables are not bound to any specific data type. The type is determined at runtime, and a variable can hold different types of values during execution.

* **Prototype-based Object Orientation**:
  JavaScript uses **prototypes** instead of classical inheritance. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.

* **First-class Functions**:
  Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens, meaning they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.

* **Event-driven**:
  JavaScript follows an event-driven model, especially in the browser environment. It listens for user interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.) and executes corresponding functions (event handlers) when events occur.

#### Common Use Cases

* Client-side scripting for dynamic web pages
* Server-side development with Node.js
* Mobile app development (e.g., React Native)
* Desktop applications (e.g., Electron)
* Game development
* IoT devices and more

Let me know if you'd like this broken down into even more technical depth (e.g., memory management, garbage collection, or how the event loop works), or if you need a separate glossary of the key terms.



### 2. What are the different data types in JavaScript?

JavaScript has 8 basic data types:

1. **Primitive Data Types**:
   - **Number**: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers (e.g., `42` or `3.14`)
   - **String**: Represents textual data (e.g., `"Hello"` or `'World'`)
   - **Boolean**: Represents logical values (`true` or `false`)
   - **Undefined**: Represents an uninitialized variable (`undefined`)
   - **Null**: Represents an intentional absence of any object value (`null`)
   - **Symbol**: Represents a unique identifier (e.g., `Symbol('description')`)
   - **BigInt**: Represents integers with arbitrary precision (e.g., `9007199254740991n`)

2. **Non-Primitive Data Type**:
   - **Object**: Represents a collection of key-value pairs
     - Regular objects: `{}`
     - Arrays: `[]`
     - Functions: `function(){}`
     - Date: `new Date()`

#### Example:

```javascript
// Primitive types
let number = 42;
let string = "Hello";
let boolean = true;
let undefinedVar;
let nullVar = null;
let symbol = Symbol('description');
let bigInt = 9007199254740991n;

// Object type
let object = {name: "John", age: 30};
let array = [1, 2, 3];
```

### 3. What is Hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the compilation phase, before the code is executed.

#### Key Points about Hoisting:

1. **Variable Hoisting**:
   - Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations
   - `var` declarations are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`
   - `let` and `const` declarations are hoisted but not initialized (temporal dead zone)

2. **Function Hoisting**:
   - Function declarations are completely hoisted with their body
   - Function expressions are not hoisted

#### Examples:

```javascript
// Variable hoisting
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 5;

// The above code is interpreted as:
var x;
console.log(x);
x = 5;

// Function hoisting
sayHello(); // Works: "Hello!"
function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello!");
}

// Function expression - doesn't work
sayGoodbye(); // Error: sayGoodbye is not a function
var sayGoodbye = function() {
    console.log("Goodbye!");
};
```

#### Best Practices:
- Always declare variables at the top of their scope
- Use `let` and `const` instead of `var` to avoid hoisting-related issues
- Declare functions before using them
